## I’m interested in Obsidian

First of all, tell me a little bit about what's your experience with note-taking apps like?

- [[I’ve used note-taking apps like Evernote and OneNote|λ:/Obsidian Sandbox/From standard note-taking]]

- [[I have used plain-text based apps|λ:/Obsidian Sandbox/From plain-text note-taking]]
