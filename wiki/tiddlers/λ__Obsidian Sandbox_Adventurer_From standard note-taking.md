Great, that means you should already be familiar with taking notes!

But hold on a second. There’s no silver bullet solution that works perfectly for everyone. Obsidian works best if you care about what we care about.

Do you have any of the following concerns below?

→ [[I don’t want my notes to been seen by others|λ:/Obsidian Sandbox/Vault is just a local folder]]

→ [[I don’t want my notes to be inaccessible someday|λ:/Obsidian Sandbox/Vault is just a local folder]]

→ [[I feel like the previous note-taking apps I used didn’t suit me well|λ:/Obsidian Sandbox/Plugins make Obsidian special for you]]

→ [[Just let me get started already|λ:/Obsidian Sandbox/Guides/Get started with Obsidian]]
