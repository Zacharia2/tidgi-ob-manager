- Click on the Sidebar - VaultTrees tab and click on the P letter link. Or click Settings (Console) - Settings tab - OBM-Panel tab.
- Enter the Obsidian Vault folder path in the text box and click the Add button.
- You can enter a regular rule in the input "Filter files" to check out only the files that match and put them in your wiki. You can choose to ignore some folders by entering an expression in the "ignore" field.
- You can use the purge button to clear your additions.
- You can see what's going on in Developer Mode - Console.

### ignore expression

Leave it empty, i.e. ignore ".git", ".obsidian", ".stfolder", ".stversions" folders by default.

Additional expression: you can type `+folder name, folder name, ... in the ignore input box. `, note that the first letter must be `+` to ignore more folders. Note the English comma.

Fully customizable: if the first letter is not `+` character, it is customized to ignore folders that need to be ignored.

### Filtering file expressions

Use regular expression to match if the file contains matching content, e.g. "def::pub", if the file contains matching content, it will be detected and written to the wiki.
